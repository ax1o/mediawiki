While Earth may not contain the largest [[list of largest lakes and seas in the Solar System|volumes of water]] in the [[Solar System]], only Earth sustains liquid surface water, [[water distribution on Earth|extending over 70.8% of the Earth]] with its [[ocean]], making Earth an [[ocean world]]. [[Earth's polar regions]] currently retain most of all other water with large [[ice sheet|sheets of ice]] covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's [[groundwater]], lakes, rivers and [[Water vapor#In Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric water]]. [[Land]], consisting of [[continent]]s and [[island]]s, extends over 29.2% of the Earth and is widely covered by [[vegetation]]. Below Earth's surface material lies [[Earth's crust]] consisting of several slowly moving [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], which interact to produce mountain ranges, [[volcano]]es, and earthquakes. Earth's [[Earth's outer core|liquid outer core]] generates a magnetic field that shapes the [[magnetosphere]] of Earth, largely deflecting destructive [[solar wind]]s and [[cosmic radiation]].\n\n[[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth has a dynamic atmosphere]], which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most [[meteoroid]]s and [[ozone layer|UV-light at entry]]. It has a composition of primarily [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. [[Water vapor]] is widely present in the atmosphere, [[Cloud#Formation|forming clouds]] that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a [[greenhouse gas]] and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of [[Solar irradiance|energy from the Sun's light]]. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76&nbsp;°C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the [[equatorial region]] receiving more sunlight than the [[polar regions]]) drive [[atmospheric circulation|atmospheric]] and [[ocean current]]s, producing a global [[climate system]] with different [[climate region]]s, and a range of [[weather]] phenomena such as [[precipitation]], allowing components such as [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] to [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]].\n\nEarth is [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|rounded]] into an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] with a [[Earth's circumference|circumference]] of about 40,000&nbsp;km. It is the [[list of Solar System objects by size|densest planet in the Solar System]]. Of the four [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]], it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight [[light-minute]]s away from the Sun and [[Earth's orbit|orbits it]], taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). The [[#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one [[claimed moons of Earth|permanent]] [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], which orbits Earth at 384,400&nbsp;km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through [[tidal locking]], the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes [[tide]]s, stabilizes Earth's axis, and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows its rotation]].\n\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, [[age of Earth|formed 4.5 billion years ago]] from gas in the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]]. During the first [[billion years]] of [[history of Earth|Earth's history]], the ocean formed and then [[Abiogenesis|life developed]] within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the [[Great Oxidation Event]] two billion years ago. [[Human]]s emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a population of 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's [[biosphere]] and natural resources for their survival, but have [[Human impact on the environment|increasingly impacted the planet's environment]]. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is [[sustainability|unsustainable]], threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, [[Holocene extinction|causing widespread extinctions]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nations |first=United |title=What Is Climate Change? |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change |access-date=17 August 2022 |website=United Nations |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Modern English]] word {{anchor|Name|Etymology}} ''Earth'' developed, via [[Middle English]], from an [[Old English]] noun most often spelled ''{{linktext|eorðe}}''.<ref name=\"oedearth\">{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=3|chapter=earth, ''n.¹''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=[[Oxford, England]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199571123.001.0001}}</ref> It has cognates in every [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], and their [[proto-Germanic|ancestral root]] has been reconstructed as [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/erþō|*''erþō'']].

From [[early Middle English]], its [[Definite article|definite sense]] as \"the globe\" was expressed as ''the'' earth. By the era of [[Early Modern English]], [[Capitalization in English#History of English capitalization|capitalization of nouns began to prevail]], and ''the earth'' was also written ''the Earth'', particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as ''Earth'', by analogy with the names of the [[Solar System|other planets]], though ''earth'' and forms with ''the'' remain common.<ref name=\"oedearth\" /> [[Style guide|House styles]] now vary: [[Oxford spelling]] recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (for example, \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by ''the'' (for example, \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Oxford Dictionary of English|edition=1st|chapter=earth|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-861263-6}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally, the name ''Terra'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛr|ə}} is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,<ref>{{OED|Terra}}</ref> while in poetry ''Tellus'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɛ|l|ə|s}} has been used to denote personification of the Earth.<ref>{{OED|Tellus}}</ref> ''Terra'' is also the name of the planet in some [[Romance languages]] (languages that evolved from [[Latin language|Latin]]) like [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Tierra'' and the [[French language|French]] ''Terre'').

Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] faces the Sun. In each instance, [[winter]] occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rohli|first1=Robert.

In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=\"bromberg2008\" />\n\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=\"lin2006\" /> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[axial precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=\"fisher19960205\" />\n\nIn modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/|title=Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles and Their Role in Earth's Climate|work=NASA|last1=Buis|first1=Alan|date=27 February 2020|access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref><ref group=\"n\" name=\"solar_energy\" /> Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year.
